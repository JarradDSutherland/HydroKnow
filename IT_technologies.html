        <h1>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Blockchain is a type of database. A database can be described as; <i> “a collection of information that
                is stored electronically on a computer system” </i> (Euromoney Learning 2021). This can be loosely
            related to a form of currency that can be stored virtually or online. A blockchain is simply a way
            of storing and recording information in the way of digital transactions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            If we think about a bank or a financial institution, their transactions are stored within their
            system. Our transactions are all monitored and traced. If we refer to the blockchain technology,
            the transactions are being stored on the blockchain itself and therefore makes it extremely
            difficult to manipulate, change or hack.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Cryptocurrency, a form of digital currency, is stored on the blockchain. It is secured by
            cryptography. This makes it almost impossible to counterfeit or double-spend (Frankenfield, 2021).
            This form of currency makes it difficult for users to become involved with fraud and other forms
            of financial criminal activity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology are said to have been created by a Japanese man called
            Satoshi Nakamoto. (ICAEW 2021) Although Mr. Nakamoto’s identity is still yet to be confirmed,
            cryptocurrency and the implementation of the first public ledger for transactions was created in
            2009. (Haar 2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Mr Nakamoto created the first public ledger, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency
            which operates free of any central control or has the oversight of banks or governments
            (Sparkes, 2021). Bitcoin is known as the mother of all cryptocurrencies and has more recently
            been called the ‘new gold’ (Wilkerson 2021). This allows the user, purchaser, or investor to
            access these cryptocurrency funds from anywhere in the world. All they require is a device with
            internet connection.
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The cryptocurrency market is expanding at a rate that we have never seen before. (Lowy 2021)
            It is currently being used for payments for generic day-to-day basics such as going through a
            McDonald’s drive thru. (McEvoy 2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This new way to pay ranges from groceries to electric cars, to apps on the Windows store!
            You can pay over the internet with cryptocurrencies in exchange for goods and services in more
            places that you would expect. The most recent controversial form of financial payments in the
            form of cryptocurrencies is VISA joining the club. (White 2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Bitcoin’s energy consumption is the hot topic. According to the University of Cambridge, “the bitcoin
            network
            currently consumes about 80 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, roughly equal to the annual output of 23
            coalfired power plants”. (McDonnell 2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The individual users and the companies that have utilised blockchains and cryptocurrencies also need to keep
            in
            mind the impact on everyday people, and the environment. With mining rigs becoming so powerful, the energy
            consumption is undesirable at a minimum. Another example of the environmental impacts is the current silicon
            shortage; which could have something to do with the boom in PC parts. (Baraniuk 2021) Between the supply and
            demand issues and the silicon shortage issues, the price of these parts has also experienced a major price
            hike,
            in turn affecting the likes of anyone who may be transitioning to working from home, for example. (Hopkins
            2021).
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            At the end of 2020, Elon Musk, the Founder and CEO of Tesla purchased approximately 1.5 billion USD worth of
            Bitcoin. (Kovach 2021) This was not just a massive personal investment either; Mr Musk was venturing into
            accepting Bitcoin as payment for his company. (NDTV 2021) With cryptocurrencies being unregulated as a
            whole, it opens up opportunities for assets that were worth potentially billions of dollars to be liquidated
            overnight.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            It is assumed that within the next decade, cryptocurrencies and blockchains will, with certainty, increase
            its
            prevalence and its value (Haar 2021). Thus, stating earlier, bitcoin is said to be the new gold. The
            requirements for banks and financial institutions may eventually be phased out and the requirement for
            manual
            labour could entirely be created through artificial intelligence (AI) and automation (Schmelzer 2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Cryptocurrencies are produced in a process called <i> mining.</i> This process produced more digital
            currencies
            where these then enter into circulation. These currencies can be mined in two ways; sophisticated hardware
            that
            solves complex mathematical calculations and also by new transaction that can be confirmed by the network.
            (Hong
            2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The two most popular cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of these currencies have the largest
            market
            capital. Market capital refers to the total money of everything in that industry. For example, every single
            Bitcoin in the world, times by the value of each coin. The current market capitalisation of all
            cryptocurrencies
            is well over 1 trillion dollars AUD. Bitcoin is also over a trillion dollars AUD in its entirety. (Trading
            View
            2021) This is a very significant amount of money in today’s value.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This pushes companies such as NVIDIA, Intel, AMD etc. to produce more and more products such as GPU’s, RAM
            (Memory) and CPU’s, which alternatively can help speed this everchanging development in the micro and macro
            environment as well as boost the production of cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Considering the massive advancements made in the realm of technology in the last few years, it is safe to
            assume
            that there will be even bigger advancements to come. This isn’t to say that there will be a replacement of
            banks
            any time soon, but we may see the trend of banking in general continue to decrease tremendously. (Celner
            2021)
            The issue that stands between cryptocurrencies becoming the norm is accessibility; it is hard to imagine
            that
            cryptocurrencies will find a way to be accessible to those who are older or who lack technological skills.
            In
            saying that, accessibility could be a next big milestone.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The potential impact of the use of blockchains and cryptocurrencies will be significant. It has the
            potential to
            widely influence everyone in the community who has access to a bank account, necessary hardware and software
            and
            those with a smartphone. (Orcutt 2019).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The potential positive impact of these technologies will be the increase in demand, which in return could
            mean
            the creation of more jobs within this area. (Bradford 2017) On the opposite end of the spectrum, it could
            also
            potentially overwork the IT industry and the advancements with the constant requirements to keep up with the
            demand and potentially burn itself out.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            With the advancements in AI and automation, we can assume that mining for crypto could become automated,
            resulting in just requiring physical aspects such as the hardware. It is said that AI and automation will
            eventually take over. On another note, there always needs to be a balance between AI and human interfaces as
            there will always be some aspects that a human will be required for. (Koval 2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Expanding on the previous point, we also need to prepare for the sudden disposability of a lot of roles
            throughout technology industries. We have already seen automation taking over in the ways of mass production
            for
            example, but this technology holds the potential to see even simple jobs overtaken by automation. In
            hindsight
            we need to be dynamic on how we adapt to everything around us, if we aren’t this could be detrimental to not
            only society, but our future. (O'Brien 2015).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            There are many applications that aid users in keeping track of and accessing their finances, both through
            banks
            and applications or web browsers for cryptocurrencies. Apps such as Coinspot and Binance for example allow
            you
            to buy, sell and stake a range of cryptocurrencies. (Sharma 2021) These trading platforms also allow you to
            store your coins in an online storage system referred to as a “hot wallet”. (Frankenfield 2021) These apps
            include tonnes of features that allow you to analyse data and specific charts for hourly or monthly
            statistics.
            These applications have made the management of funds a breeze, but this was not always the case; for
            example,
            when you are required to fill out a paper application in-person for a loan from a bank or opening a bank
            account.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The impact of cryptocurrencies on the general public has already made a lasting impression. Cryptocurrencies
            have now become a major talking point with friends, family, the media, celebrities and with only recently,
            El-Salvador creating bitcoin as a national legal tender. (Bartholomeusz 2021).

        <h1> Cybersecurity</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Cybersecurity can broadly be considered as the set of techniques that protect the confidentiality,
            integrity,
            and availability (commonly referred to as the CIA model) of computer systems and the information they
            contain.
            In an environment where networked devices are ubiquitous to businesses, organisations, and individuals,
            cybersecurity technologies play a role across every spectrum of computing.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Cybersecurity needs to constantly evolve in line with developments in computing capabilities and the threats
            that seek to take advantage of them. Where traditional approaches focused on protecting a network perimeter
            from
            known threats, the speed at which threats evolve today require more proactive cybersecurity strategies (De
            Groot
            2020). Those traditional network perimeters are disappearing with the adoption of cloud-based services and
            remote work arrangements which has removed any separation between personal and organisation’s networks, and
            there has been commensurate increase in network activity as a result.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The COVD-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend, which has had implications to cybersecurity; Panetta (2021)
            reports that remote working is now available to 64% of workers, with 40% employing it. Another recent issue
            is
            the growth of the Internet of Things (Iot), which has seen the creation of millions of connected devices,
            each
            with their own security implications and cybersecurity challenges.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Considering the contemporary environment, cybersecurity practices acknowledge that not all threats can be
            feasibly stopped outside the network. Behaviour analytics is a technology that cybersecurity professionals
            have
            utilised to proactively protect against unknown threats, such as zero-day attacks, unauthorised access, or
            insider attacks. Behaviour analytics examines the trends, patterns and activities of users, applications,
            and
            networks to detect threats in real-time (Incognito Forensic Foundation 2019).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Using specialised algorithms and machine-learning technology, behavioural analysis looks for anomalies
            across
            network activity or in user’s behaviour (Greengard n.d.). It analyses interactions of applications with
            systems
            to predict malicious attacks based on that activity, rather than needing to identify known historic malware
            code, the method which traditional systems rely on (Forcepoint n.d.).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Utilising behaviour analytics in cybersecurity can be resource intensive, and research indicates that
            current
            implementation suits larger enterprises (Figueiredo 2019). Despite this, the technology also shows signs of
            creating new efficiencies. Hamblen (2016) reports realised efficiencies with the reduced need for IT teams
            to
            review lengthy event logs to identify incidents. Using behaviour analytics technology enables the quick
            identification by drilling down to the specific event. This efficiency will be particularly valuable to
            smaller
            enterprises with generally smaller IT teams with competing priorities.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Another tool that experts are leaning on to tackle modern cybersecurity challenges is hardware
            authentication.
            This is not a new technology, but advancements in cloud computing and the associated prevalence of remote
            work
            have brought it to the forefront as a valuable tool. The modern security landscape has been extended beyond
            the
            traditional siloed networks with known and controlled devices, and so authenticating network users has
            become of
            critical importance.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Traditional authentication asks ‘who the user is’ (username) and ‘what they know’ (password) (Incognito
            Forensic
            Foundation 2019). Adding an additional factor asking ‘what they have’ adds another layer of security that
            can
            mitigate the well understood deficiencies of the username and password (Mell n.d.). Technologies such as
            finger-print and facial detection have brought this to consumer-grade products, while tokens that generate
            one-time-passwords are common across business enterprises. The explosion of the IoT is another factor that
            has
            brought hardware authentication to the forefront. Managing machine identities has become a critical security
            capability to organisations employing connected devices and sensors.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Encryption and tokenization technology is a means that cybersecurity enables persistent access to authorised
            users over open networks and the cloud. Data in transit cannot feasibly be prevented from unauthorised
            interception without giving up the major benefits of cloud computing. Encrypting data allows information to
            be
            transmitted in a meaningless format, readable only to systems that hold a key (Net Diligence 2013).
            Tokenisation
            substitutes the data entirely, transmitting only a token that corresponds to the protected data which is
            held
            only by a trusted central agency (Acharjee 2021). This is particularly useful for electronic commerce
            payments,
            allowing payment information to be substituted for the token so that merchants don’t have access to
            customer’s
            credit information.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Quantum computing, while still nascent, poses a great issue for cybersecurity in the near future. One of the
            main security risks it poses is to cryptography, which as discussed above is a fundamental tool in modern
            computing. A quantum computer employed by adversaries, has the potential to defeat today’s encryption
            technologies (World Economic Forum 2020). While the fundamental notion that a technology can be used both to
            defend, or attack stands true with quantum computing, the immediate onus is on the defender to forearm
            themselves now, before the technology is in the hands of the attacker. As systems with long lifespans
            continue
            to be rolled out that will remain beyond the likely introduction of quantum computing, they must implement
            resistant technologies ahead of the hardware (World Economic Forum 2020).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            These technologies will have huge impact to the cybersecurity industry. Workforce capacity will need to
            increase
            rapidly for risk of being a step behind technological advancements. The Australian Government Department of
            Industry, Science, Energy and Resources predict an 11% annualised growth of the domestic sector. In the
            immediate term, the sheer size of the security landscape will put ever increasing pressure on cybersecurity
            professionals. Technologies such as AI, machine learning, and automation must be continually evolved and
            employed to prevent security professionals from being overwhelmed by the dynamic and expanding nature of
            cybersecurity threats. Uses of these technologies, as is ubiquitous in cybersecurity, will also be employed
            by
            cyber criminals to counter any existing defences, and to further exploit systems (World Economic Forum
            2019).
            Due to this paradigm, I do not foresee the efficiencies and developments that the technology enables
            reducing
            any of the burden on cyber security professionals. It will simply represent another tool that they must
            employ
            in order to remain competitive with their adversaries.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            As students of Information Technology, cybersecurity can only play an increasing role in both our studies
            and
            future endeavours in the broader industry. The high-growth industry may present significant opportunities
            for
            today’s IT students. Perhaps more than other areas of IT, cybersecurity demands constant education to stay
            abreast of contemporary issues and developments, so will be an enduring topic over an IT professional’s
            career.
            The evolving cybersecurity industry and general move to SaaS tools does offer opportunity for smaller
            enterprises to outsource a significant portion of its cybersecurity needs. Service such as Extended
            Detection
            and Response (XDR) systems will take strides in centralising these needs, creating efficiencies for smaller
            security operations teams (Novinson 2021). These developments will likely mean a broader pool of IT
            professionals, not just cybersecurity experts, will have a touch point with security concerns, albeit
            through
            external providers.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            For the non-IT professional, many of whom are now working remotely, they will be indirectly affected by the
            need
            to constantly evolve security technologies. In the immediate term, services traditionally using a username
            and
            password are introducing multi-factor authentication with a degree of increased complexity for the general
            computing user. I believe everyone will need to become more aware of the cybersecurity landscape. As
            technology
            itself plays an ever-pervasive role in our lives, cybersecurity will similarly play a larger part. Each user
            maintaining an awareness of the risks and dangers is an important factor in the integrity of the larger
            cybersecurity system. Of note, the ever-increasing complexity of these developments and cybersecurity’s
            impact
            on society place the elderly or technology-inexperienced at disadvantage, and place a responsibility on the
            community at large to protect them, just as with any vulnerable segment of society.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <h1>Machine Learning </h1>
        Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that imitates the way a human brain operates and uses
        neural
        networks and experimentation to gradually improve upon its accuracy through the use of generations of data (IBM
        Cloud Education, 2020)(2020). This process takes a lot of time as the program begins in an infant state with
        every
        new subject it is learning, first the program must be given data, known as ‘training data,’ to identify
        parameters
        on which to operate and make decisions, it will then build on that database with each generation and learn
        whether
        it is doing the task correctly. The program will go through many generations before it starts to yield positive
        results, though with the processing speed of the computer considered and depending on the complexity of the task
        at
        hand, this process can take thousands of attempts to solve even the most basic of concepts.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This technology has deep roots going back to 1952 where Arthur Samuel developed a program to learn the game
            of
            checkers using an alpha-beta pruning method, this would measure the chances of each side winning before
            making a
            play based on the minimax strategy, which would go on to be the minimax algorithm. At this time computers
            were much
            slower, and it wasn’t until 1962 when the computer program beat Robert Nealey, a self-proclaimed master, in
            a
            historical match (IBM Cloud Education, 2020)(2020).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            These days Machine Learning has an impact on many aspects of our lives, from Google Maps suggested traffic
            routes to
            shopping online with websites like Amazon. But some of the front runners for this technology reside in the
            field of
            medicine. Machine learning algorithms can sort through data from clinical trials and patient history, it
            will then
            compare that data to the latest research taken in that field and tailor a treatment protocol that best suits
            the
            patient's needs, saving the patient money and unnecessary tests (Project Pro, 2021)(2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Pfizer has been using Machine learning for years on its immuno-oncology research to sieve through the data
            to assist
            research in drug discovery, especially combining multiple drugs and deciding on the best participant for
            clinical
            trials. Machine learning has also been effectively utilised in the Banking sector, where they have
            algorithms that
            sift through thousands of transactions per customer to detect unusual activity and put a hold on fraudulent
            transactions. They also detect patterns of purchases and links to organised crime using this same
            technology. Using
            this technology has already saved customers thousands of dollars but is also assisting to protect the
            general public
            from criminals getting their hands on illegal weaponry.(Gavrilova 2020).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Moving forward into the not-so-distant future we can already see the likely impact of Machine Learning in
            our
            everyday lives, soon we will have robots or drones powered with Machine Learning taking full control of bomb
            disposal, which currently still requires human input to operate. Utilising these drones has already saved
            thousands
            of lives and will continue to save thousands more (Elite Data Science, n.d).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            According to (Weissgraeber, 2021), a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be
            giving rise
            to hyper-personalisation and greater customer experience within the e-commerce sector. Websites will create
            an
            algorithmic e-commerce experience where customers will receive customised shopping experiences akin to a
            personalised sales pitch. This shift in the market will provide a greater customer experience and deliver
            more value
            to each customer based on their needs at any given moment.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Machine learning will likely impact the world drastically in the near future, as technology improves,
            policies,
            regulations and laws will all need to be updated to accommodate the shift. In the e-commerce sector, privacy
            will be
            one of the biggest concerns, utilising customers data as they already do borders on ethical rights, but with
            additional Machine Learning technology sifting through even more data, it will become a necessity for this
            information to be even more protected. Leading to more roles in cybersecurity, better infrastructure in data
            servers
            and better privacy laws.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            One major concern that doesn’t seem to be of concern yet, but still warrants the discussion. Is the
            possibility of
            Technological Singularity, also referred to as superintelligence, where an AI surpasses human intelligence
            and can
            be comparatively competent in creativity, wisdom, and social skills (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). The
            technology for
            deepfakes is getting close to this point from a media perspective, already it is difficult to tell the
            difference
            between the original and a fake unless you know what to look for. Moving into the future this will only get
            harder
            and press conferences and mainstream news outlets may become the only reliable source for current events for
            fear of
            an impersonator.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            According to (Deshmukh, 2021), the 12 jobs most likely to be replaced by AI and Machine Learning are
            customer
            service executives, bookkeeping and data entry, receptionists, proofreading, manufacturing and
            pharmaceutical work,
            retail services, couriers’ services, doctors, soldiers, taxi and bus drivers, market research analysts and
            security
            guards. Instead of taking away these roles completely, it should result in a shift in the market with most
            of these
            roles being supplemented with Machine Learning technology.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence is set to change the world as we know it and already has subtle
            impacts
            on our daily lives, but I can see these impacts already becoming more pronounced as the technology improves.
            I can
            already picture a future where your home computer knows what website you would like to see before you load
            it, based
            on the discussions in and around the home. Virtual assistants will become a necessity to plan your daily
            schedule
            and to keep track of any appointments. They will also be incredibly useful with our ever-growing diversity
            and using
            text-speech or speech-speech technology to allow people from all walks of life to be able to communicate
            with each
            other regardless of language barriers.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The biggest change we would need to get used to, or at least find ways of handling effectively, would be a
            major
            impact on our privacy. With Machine Learning having immense amounts of data at hand and being able to learn
            and
            grow, potentially compiling more data and creating mega-servers, it will only be a matter of time until
            nothing is
            secret. The only other option would be for individuals to be much more careful of the information they
            choose to
            make public.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Everyone will be impacted by this; every company will be using Machine Learning algorithms to improve
            efficiency and
            to target a bigger audience. I currently work at a restaurant, and I can imagine a Machine Learning program
            that
            would help sort through a customer database to better advertise an upcoming special based on each customers
            prior
            dining experiences.

            Whilst Machine Learning isn’t by any means a new technology, the recent jumps in processing power now makes
            it a
            more increasingly useful technology. The future is looking more and more robotic that’s for sure.

        <h1> Autonomous Vehicles </h1>
        Autonomous driving is becoming more reality than science fiction of late, especially with some of the latest
        developments in the field. However, there’s still a long way to go before we start seeing fully autonomous
        vehicles
        on our streets. There is currently a race between companies to see who the first will be to develop an automated
        vehicle safe to let loose on the streets. Some notable companies, including Waymo, Uber, Toyota, Apple, and
        Tesla,
        are all working hard on autonomous vehicles.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Waymo runs a service called Waymo One in Phoenix, Arizona, where customers can call a car and set a
            destination,
            with stops along the way if needed. This automated service is only possible in several cities in the Metro
            Phoenix
            area, working similarly to a taxi. This is due to the necessity for vigorous scanning of the city’s
            environment so
            that the automated vehicle can have a clear understanding of where it is at all times, as merely relying on
            GPS
            alone can be limiting in situations. They have also launched a Trusted Tester program in San Francisco,
            where they
            intend to launch Waymo One soon!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Using a complex mash-up of machine learning coupled with Lidar, Cameras and Radar, the computer within the
            vehicle
            can generate a picture of its surrounding environment. Based on the simulations and other driving the
            computer has
            previously done, it can make driving decisions. Following this principle, it’s vital to get a better
            autonomous
            driver that you give the computer as much practice as possible to help prepare it for any situation on the
            road.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Waymo, currently on their website, claims to have done millions of miles on public roads and billions of
            miles in
            simulations, which has helped their company get to where they are today. However, the road to autonomous
            vehicles
            isn’t all golden. Waymo has hit a speedbump in development, finding the computer struggles with minor
            disturbances
            such as cyclists, construction crews and pedestrians as well as rain or snow (Coppola & Bergen 2021). These
            are all
            obstacles that will need to be overcome before there’s any hint of a commercially viable autonomous vehicle
            rollout.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Tesla is another notable company with its well-known autopilot feature that uses multiple cameras,
            ultrasonic
            sensors, and radar to auto steer the car and automatically accelerate and brake. However, it is very limited
            in
            functionality and always requires the driver’s full attention by having their hands placed on the steering
            wheel to
            enable the feature.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Lidar is one of the tremendous advancements as of late in the autonomous vehicle sector! It’s essentially
            the eyes
            of the vehicle, which constantly rotate, sending thousands of laser pulses every second, which are reflected
            off the
            surrounding environment, then translated by a computer into a real-time 3D model. The computer can then
            interpret
            this information and, from its machine learning experience, judge how to react to the environment, whether
            that’s to
            stop, turn or accelerate (Choudhary 2020).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            For the adoption of autonomous vehicles to work, some key things need to happen. First off, more practice.
            Machine
            learning requires large amounts of data to help the computer get better and better. The computer’s ability
            to drive
            would need to be exceptional to trump an individual just hopping in the car and driving themselves.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The cost is a significant factor too. We’ve already seen Lidar’s drop from costing around $75,000 in 2015 to
            $100 in
            2021, being the size of a soft drink can (Dans 2021). Safety is a crucial factor in the successful rollout
            of
            Autonomous vehicles, so only time will tell, as teams keep training computers to become better and better
            drivers
            and as technologies become cheaper and more accessible for use.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            According to the World Health Organization’s report on road traffic injuries, approximately 1.3 million
            people die
            each year because of road traffic crashes (World Health Organization, 2021). These are often related to
            using mobile
            phones whilst driving, speeding, not using safety equipment (e.g., seatbelts or helmets) and drivers under
            the
            influence of alcohol and or illicit substances.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The hope with the development of Autonomous Vehicles is that it will remove or drastically lower the risk of
            human
            error, leading to fewer injuries and fatalities occurring on roads across the world. Another benefit of
            Autonomous
            Vehicles being introduced is for the elderly and those who have a disability preventing them from driving.
            This
            would give those with a disability much more freedom to continue travelling around to do the everyday things
            they
            love to do! This, however, would only be possible if Level 5 of Vehicle Autonomy was reached. Vehicles that
            are
            Level-5 capable are fully autonomous, with no driver required behind the wheel (APTIV, 2021).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Concerning jobs and the rise of autonomous vehicles, whilst some may become redundant, other, new jobs may
            also
            appear as a result. Particularly jobs in the truck driving and taxi sector will most likely become obsolete,
            as
            autonomous vehicles will be able to drive themselves. However, this does require Level 5 automation to be
            implemented, which is still a long way off.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Another factor to consider, as these high-tech vehicles come into existence, due to their complex nature,
            will
            require specialists to maintain them and perform repairs, which would require specialised training. There
            are also
            new jobs that could arrive, such as Teleoperation, which involves controlling vehicles from a control room,
            which is
            more likely to appear sooner rather than later as it doesn’t require the vehicle to be fully automated,
            Level 5
            vehicle. The real impacts of Automated Vehicles will continue to be observed as further developments in the
            field
            are made.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I don’t think autonomous driving would have a massive impact on me until it was widely accepted worldwide
            and
            reached Level 5 vehicle automation. However, if we did get to that point, in terms of daily life, the
            workday
            commute would be much more peaceful, not having to deal with frustrating drivers and sketchy moments. I
            would sit
            back and relax, letting the computer do the driving, freeing up some time to ease myself into the workday. I
            think
            if this were the case, it would be a lot better for everyone’s mental health, especially for those who find
            driving
            stressful and scary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Another significant benefit would be parking. Parking can be one of the most tedious things to do and
            sometimes
            finding a car park is harder. I’d imagine the autonomous vehicle, connected to other vehicles, would know
            where to
            find a free parking spot, making the experience so much quicker and less stressful for me, the passenger.
            However,
            something I would miss, and I know many others would, is driving itself. As stressful as driving can be, it
            is still
            enjoyable, especially on the more open, country roads.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Autonomous cars would be helpful for people like my grandparents! One of the main reason’s Nanna stopped
            driving is
            because she finds it too stressful on the roads. With more and more people being out on the roads and after
            some bad
            experiences, she decided to give it up. If autonomous vehicles were widely used, she would be so much more
            mobile,
            whilst her family still does pick her up and take her places she needs to, such as a doctor's appointment,
            at the
            push of a button!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The actual effects, good or bad, won't indeed be known until Autonomous vehicles are released on the
            streets. Until
            then, I am more than happy to drive myself!
